# Flight Booker Project

In this project, we'll build the first three steps of a typical checkout process for booking a one-way flight:

1. Enter desired dates / airports and click "Search"
2. Choose from among a list of eligible flights
3. Enter passenger information for all passengers

The purpouse of this project is to get hands on experience on advanced forms - and it's part of TheOdinProject course on Ruby on Rails. For more information about The Odin Project, follow this link: http://www.theodinproject.com/home
